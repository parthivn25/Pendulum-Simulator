# Pendulum Simulator
The program allows a user to view a visual model of a pendulum/double pendulum with initial conditions of their choice. The program uses derivations from the Euler-Lagrange equations of each pendulum's angle with the vertical axis to output a gif that models the motion of the pendulums. The model considers identical masses with rigid rods of equal lengths supporting the pendulums.

The following is an example of the program's result for a damped double pendulum given the initial conditions of a 45 degree angle on the first pendulum with a 60 degree angle on the second, which is pushed with an angular velocity of 8 radians per second.
